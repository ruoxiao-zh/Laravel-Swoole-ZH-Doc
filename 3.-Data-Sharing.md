## Data Sharing

As mentioned previously, **Laravel** applications run in different worker processes. There's one important concept  to keep in mind: `Variables are not shared across different processes`.

Each worker has their own variables and memory allocations. Keeping **Laravel** in memory doesn't mean we can share data among different processes.

There are, though, many options to share resources between processes:

* Databases like MySQL and Redis
* APCu - APC User Cache
* Swoole Table
* Any other I/O based alternatives

## Swoole Table

In `swoole_http.php`, you can customize your own Swoole Table:

```php
use Swoole\Table;

'tables' => [
    // define your table name here
    'table_name' => [
        // table rows number
        'size' => 1024,
        // column name, column type and column type size are optional for int and float type
        'columns' => [
            ['name' => 'column_name1', 'type' => Table::TYPE_INT],
            ['name' => 'column_name2', 'type' => Table::TYPE_STRING, 'size' => 1024],
        ]
    ],
]
```

There are three column types of Swoole Table:

1. **TYPE_INT**: 1，2，4，8
2. **TYPE_FLOAT**: 8
3. **TYPE_STRING**: the nth power of 2

## Usage

```php
<?php

use SwooleTW\Http\Table\Facades\Table;

class Foo
{
    // get a table by its name
    $table = Table::get('table_name');

    // update a row of the table by key
    $table->set('key', 'value');

    // get a row of the table by key
    $table->get('key');

    // delete a row of the table by key
    $table->del('key');

    // check if a row is existed by key
    $table->exist('key');

    // count the rows in the table
    $table->count();
}
```
