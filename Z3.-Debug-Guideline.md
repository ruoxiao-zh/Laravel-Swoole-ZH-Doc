## Debug Guideline

Although this package provides a sandbox container to prevent properties of container being influenced by your codes, sometimes there are still other unexpected issues. This guideline can shed some light on your debugging.

1. Make some changes in your `config/swoole_http.php`

```php
'server' => [
    'options' => [
        'daemonize' => false,
        'worker_num' => 1,
    ]
],
'ob_output' => false,
```

> Limiting your worker number is to make sure your requests won't be processed by different workers. Turn off `ob_output` can help you dump some debug message on the console.

2. For example, if you get the same `auth` user in every request, you can try to dump some message in `Illuminate\Auth\AuthServiceProvider::class` 

```php
protected function registerAuthenticator()
{
    $this->app->singleton('auth', function ($app) {
        var_dump('auth resoved');
        // the reset code
    }
}
```

Restart your server and inspect your console if your `auth` instance being resolved every time.

3. There are some pre-resolved instances that will be shared by sandbox container:

```php
'view', 'files', 'session', 'session.store', 'routes',
'db', 'db.factory', 'cache', 'cache.store', 'config', 'cookies',
'encrypter', 'hash', 'router', 'translator', 'url', 'log'
```

These instances won't be resolved in every request. You can still set specific instances to `instances` config in `swoole_http.php` to reset them like below:

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Instances here will be cleared on every request.
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*/
'instances' => [
    'log', 'cache'
],
```

4. Some providers might use dirty app to register their instances, for example, in `PaginationServiceProvider`:

```php
Paginator::currentPageResolver(function ($pageName = 'page') {
    $page = $this->app['request']->input($pageName);
    // ...
});
```

The app variable is not injected from the closure. It's from the service provider itself. However, service providers are only registered in the very beginning of booting up application. So, the `request` instance here won't be refreshed. The better way should be:

```php
Paginator::currentPageResolver(function ($pageName = 'page') use ($app) {
    $page = $app['request']->input($pageName);
    // ...
});
```

So this package provides a solution for this kind of situations. You can specify the service providers you want to   re-register every time.  Just add your service providers to `providers` config in `swoole_http.php`:

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Providers here will be registered on every request.
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*/
'providers' => [
    Illuminate\Pagination\PaginationServiceProvider::class,
],
```

> The package will replace the app in service container with the sandbox app automatically.

5. If the packages you installed or any providers are related to authentication(eg. Laravel Passport), please reset them manually.

6. If you install other packages in your application, you should try to make a minimum implementation in a clean Laravel project first to see if the bug still happens. Some packages might have some dirty codes to cause unexpected bugs.
