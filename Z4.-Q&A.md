## Q&A

1. Is there any prerequisite to use this package?

Yes, Swoole extension(`>1.9.3`) and PHP `7.1` are required for using this package.

2. Does Swoole support Windows system?

No, currently Swoole doesn't support Windows. Ubuntu on Windows 10 can run Swoole, but it's still not recommended for production environment.

3. Can I use this package on my current Laravel projects out of the box?

Yes and no, different from traditional PHP lifecycle, your Laravel application will only boot on the first time and persist in the memory. That means some of your original code may make app become dirty and cause unexpected bugs in this case. (see more at [Swoole Structure](https://github.com/swooletw/laravel-swoole/wiki/2.-Swoole-Structure))

This package provides basic protection for app container though, but there are still some limitations you need to keep in mind. Please see [Notices](https://github.com/swooletw/laravel-swoole/wiki/Z1.-Notices) for more details.

So it depends on if your code violates these limitations. 

4. How can I trace a bug that doesn't happen in traditional PHP?

Having better understanding in multi-process programming, [Swoole structure](https://github.com/swooletw/laravel-swoole/wiki/2.-Swoole-Structure), [Laravel lifecycle](https://crnkovic.me/laravel-behind-the-scenes-lifecycle-container) and [Container](https://gist.github.com/davejamesmiller/bd857d9b0ac895df7604dd2e63b23afe) can help you a lot figure out what's going on with your bug.

Following [Debug Guideline](https://github.com/swooletw/laravel-swoole/wiki/Z3.-Debug-Guideline) can also help you trace your bug more easily.

5. Does `xxx` package work with this package?

We can not guarantee every third-party pacakge will work with this package. Especially some packages are not designed with the consideration in this use case.

6. Does this package support hot reload in developing?

Yes, but the watching module is separate from this package. You can check [swooletw/watcher](https://github.com/swooletw/watcher) for more details.

> The watching module is implemented with `node.js`. Make sure you install `node` environment before using it.
