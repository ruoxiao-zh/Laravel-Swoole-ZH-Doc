## Notices

1. Please reload or restart the swoole_http_server after released your code. Because the Laravel program will be kept in memory after the swoole_http_server started. That's why the swoole_http_server has high performance.
2. Never use `dd()`, `exit()` or `die()` function to print your debug message. It will terminate your swoole worker unexpectedly.
3. `global` and `static` variables needs to be destroyed(reset) manually.
4. Infinitely appending element into static/global variable will lead to memory leak.
```php
// Some class
class Test
{
    public static $array = [];
    public static $string = '';
}

// Controller
public function test(Request $req)
{
    // Memory leak
    Test::$array[] = $req->input('param1');
    Test::$string .= $req->input('param2');
}
```
5. `flush()`/`ob_flush()`/`ob_end_flush()`/`ob_implicit_flush()` are not supported in  swoole response.
6. Don't use `header()`/`setcookie()`/`http_response_code()` in your response, only return in illuminate response.
7. Request header can not exceed `8 KB`. This is restricted by Swoole.
8. By default the max size of POST data/file is `10 MB` which is restricted by `package_max_length` in Swoole.
9. You should have basic knowledge about multi-process programming and Swoole. If you still write your code with traditional php concept, your app might have unexpected bugs.
