## Installation

This package relies on **Swoole** extension. Make sure you've installed **Swoole** before using this package. Using this command to install it quickly:

```
pecl install swoole
```

After installing the extension, you will need to edit `php.ini` and add `extension=swoole.so` line before using it.

```
php -i | grep php.ini                      # check the php.ini file location
sudo echo "extension=swoole.so" >> php.ini  # append "extension=swoole.so" to the end of php.ini
php -m | grep swoole                       # check if the Swoole extension has been enabled
```

> Visit the [official website](https://www.swoole.co.uk/docs/get-started/installation) for more information.

> Notice: Swoole currently only supports Linux and OSX. Windows servers are not able to use Swoole yet.

Require this package with composer:

```
$ composer require swooletw/laravel-swoole
```

Then, add the service provider:

> It supports Package Auto Discovery. If your Laravel version is above 5.5, please skip this step. 

If using Laravel, add the Service Provider to the `providers` array in `config/app.php`:

```php
[
    'providers' => [
        SwooleTW\Http\LaravelServiceProvider::class,
    ],
]
```

If using Lumen, append the following line to `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
$app->register(SwooleTW\Http\LumenServiceProvider::class);
```
