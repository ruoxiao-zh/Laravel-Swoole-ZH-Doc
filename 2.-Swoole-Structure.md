## Swoole Structure

**Swoole** is designed for higher-level developers. Using this package doesn't require those knowledge bases but it's highly recommended to understand basic lifecycles of **Laravel** and **Swoole**.

This is the main structure for **Swoole**. Basically, there are few components you need to keep in mind:

* **Master Process**: This is the original process when you execute your PHP script. It will fork a main Reactor and a Manager. It is the root process for the whole application.
* **Main Reactor**: Reactor in **Swoole** is `multi-thread` and totally `asynchronous` implemented with `epoll` in Linux Kernel or `kqueue` in OSX. Reactor is in charge of receiving connected requests and deliver to Manager process. In simple words, its function is just like Nginx Server.
* **Manager**: Manager process will fork multiple Worker processes. When any Worker terminates, it will automatically fork another Worker process to keep an accurate amount of Worker numbers.
* **Worker**: This is where you should really care about. All the requests(main logics) will be processed in Worker.
* **Task Worker**: Same function as Worker process, but only for task delivery. Workers can deliver tasks to a task queue asynchronously. And Task Workers are in charge of consuming tasks from this queue.

**Laravel** application will exist in Worker processes. Each **Laravel** application will be loaded and bootstrapped only one time when Worker process starts up. That means **Laravel** can be stored and kept in memory. No more needs to load the whole **Laravel** every time you process a request.

This is the key point why we can speed up **Laravel** but also the dangerous part which may cause strange problems. Container is the core concept of **Laravel** structure. It can be used for application binding, singleton, resolving applications, dependency injections and more.

In the past, we don't need to care about the usages of `global properties`, `static class`, `singletons`. Now it matters.

As what I said above, **Laravel** application will exist in the memory and only initialize at the first time. Any changes you did to **Laravel** will be kept unless you reset them by yourself.

For example, `auth` in **Laravel** is registered as `singleton`. Here is the partial code of `SessionGaurd`:

```php
if (! is_null($this->user)) {
    return $this->user;
}
```

It looks pretty normal and reasonable for caching resolved user object. But in our case, this is a fatal problem. That will cause you getting wrong user object after your first user resolving.

Any solutions? Yes, this package provides a sandbox to prevent some common unexpected bugs.

### Sandbox Container

All your requests will be processed in a sandbox of App Container. Any changes to `Application` class will not affect the initial **Laravel** application. Application bindings will also be resolved in every request. That means `singleton` instances only exist in the current request, and will not interfere with other requests.

But some instances will be pre-resolved in the begining for unncessary repeated resolving:

```php
'view', 'files', 'session', 'session.store', 'routes',
'db', 'db.factory', 'cache', 'cache.store', 'config', 'cookies',
'encrypter', 'hash', 'router', 'translator', 'url', 'log'
```

In every request, it will generate a new sandbox for single request processing.

There's also a `instances` config for you to add customized instances you want to reset in each request.

```php
'instances' => [
    'instanceA', 'instanceB'
],
``` 

> This still cannot prevent modifying `global` and `static` variables. You should avoid using them in any case unless you know what you're doing.
