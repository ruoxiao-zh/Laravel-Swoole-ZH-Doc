## Facades

There are some facades you can use in your **Laravel** Application:

* `SwooleTW\Http\Server\Facades\Server`: Swoole server instance, you will rarely need this class unless you're familiar with Swoole server. You can get current server info by the following:

```php
$data = Server::stats();

// response data
array(8) {
  // the launched time of Swoole server
  ["start_time"]=>
  int(1525352666)
  // the number of current connections 
  ["connection_num"]=>
  int(1)
  // the number of connections accepted
  ["accept_count"]=>
  int(1)
  // the number of connections closed
  ["close_count"]=>
  int(0)
  // the number of task which is queuing up
  ["tasking_num"]=>
  int(0)
  // the number of request received
  ["request_count"]=>
  int(0)
  // the number of request received by the current worker
  ["worker_request_count"]=>
  int(0)
  // current coroutine number
  ["coroutine_num"]=>
  int(1)
}
```

$table = SwooleTable::get('table_name');
// or you can also call like this
$table = SwooleTable::table_name;

// get all registered tables
$tables = SwooleTable::getAll();
```

* `SwooleTW\Http\Websocket\Facades\Websocket`: Websocket class provided by this package.

* `SwooleTW\Http\Websocket\Facades\Room`: You can get some room infos by this class.

```php
// get all fds by a room name
$fds = Room::getClients('room_name');
